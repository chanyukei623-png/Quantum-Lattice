ðŸ§® Lattice Models, Potential Wells & Tight-Binding Simulations

This project explores a wide variety of quantum lattice models, including:

Tight-binding models (1D, 2D)

Potential well simulations (single and periodic)

SSH (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger) models in 1D and 2D

Band structure calculations using Bloch Hamiltonians

Custom lattice geometries and transformations

The simulations are implemented using NumPy, Matplotlib, and QuTiP (for quantum operators). These models provide insight into band formation, eigenstates, and topological edge modes.
